        <h3>Here's a timeline of J. Cole's life.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            1985 - Jermaine Lamar Cole was born on January 28 At a US Army base
            in Frankfurt.
          </li>
          <li>
            2007 - The Come Up came out, It was largely self-produced, but also
            saw him rapping over beats from Kanye West, also co-founding his own
            non-profit label <strong>Dreamville</strong> with his his bestfriend
            Ibrahim Hamad.
          </li>
          <li>
            2010 - Friday Night Lights, consisted of songs rejected from Cole’s
            debut studio album. That album, Cole World: The Sideline Story,
            finally saw the light of day in 2011 and would go on to be certified
            platinum. Critics hailed a promising artist, with the L.A. Times
            praising the “satisfying confidence” of his rhymes and the “slickly
            inventive beats.”
          </li>
          <li>
            2013 - Born Sinner, it was another success. Kendrick Lamar and 50
            Cent were among the guests, on an album that was warmly, but not
            ecstatically, received.
          </li>
          <li>
            2014 - With momentum building, 2014 Forest Hills Drive came out in
            December 2014 and premiered at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, despite a
            lack of advance singles or marketing. It won several awards,
            including Billboard Rap Album of the Year, and was later certified
            double platinum, This was impressive for an
            <strong> that had no guest appearances</strong>.

            2016 - His fourth studio album, 4 Your Eyez Only, came out just
            before Christmas 2016 and also went to No. 1. Despite a minor
            controversy over what some saw as lyrical barbs directed at Kanye
            West and Drake, it was another guest-free set that found favor. The
            New York Times suggested that by freeing himself of the shackles of
            big-name guest stars,
          </li>

            opening-day streaming record en route to the Billboard top spot.
            Days later, it was announced that Cole had become the first artist
            to debut three simultaneous singles on the Billboard Hot 100, with
            "Kevin's Heart," "ATM" and KOD's title track all surfacing on the
            chart.

            album "THE FALL-OFF", as J cole's 7th album studio,It became Cole's
            first album since 2013's Born Sinner to contain guest features.
